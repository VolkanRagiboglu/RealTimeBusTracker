# RealTimeBusTracker
Started with Real-Time Bus Tracker, refactored to Real-Time Bus Tracker and Direction Populator

This project will track the stations between the coordinates that we provide and also improve to populate direction as needed.

Refactoring:

On top of the base bus tracking app, added a different styling by using styles.css
Added, a second HTML file for searching by directions and set it to the same center coordinates as the other HTML file
Added async functions in mapdirections.js file to clean up the base code and pars data to html-css
How to install:

Create a repository
Fork the following files down below
Save those files to your local machine
How to run: Download the following files for the base Bus Tracker app -> index.html - mapanimation.js - styles.css and for the Direction Populator -> index2.html - mapdirections.js

Open up a html file and if you're using Visual Studio Code, open it on a browser
If you want to add/edit styling, check the styles.css file in your IDE
For Testing some of the functions go to .js files for both animation and directions
A reminder that, for future references and improvements, always use a ReadMe file to document your work
