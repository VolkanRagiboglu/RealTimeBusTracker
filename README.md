# RealTimeBusTracker
Started with Real-Time Bus Tracker, refactored to Real-Time Bus Tracker and Direction Populator

This project will track the stations between the coordinates that is provided and also improve to populate direction as needed.

Refactoring:
1. On top of the base bus tracking app, added a different styling by using styles.css
2. Added, a second HTML file for searching by directions and set it to the same center coordinates as the other HTML file
3. Added async functions in mapdirections.js file to clean up the base code and pars data to html-css


How to install:
1. Create a repository
2. Fork the following files down below
3. Save those files to your local machine

How to run:
Download the following files for the base Bus Tracker app -> index.html - mapanimation.js - styles.css 
and for the Direction Populator -> index2.html - mapdirections.js
1. Open up an html file and if you're using Visual Studio Code, open it on a browser
2. If you want to add/edit styling, check the styles.css file in your IDE
3. For Testing some of the functions go to .js files for both animation and directions
4. Reminder that, for future references and improvements, always use a ReadMe file to document your work
